# Checker
Web based checker game.

This project was done for a school project in conjunction with my other teammates Jisook, Xavier and David.

This game utilizes spark and Java to build an online checker game and includes feature such as replay and highlight.

The front-end of the project such as Javascript and the images files were provided to us by the school. The rest of the project were made by us. My main contribution to the project was completing the back-end gaming logic, writing routes and implementing the highlight feature which allows you to see what are the possible moves you can make.
